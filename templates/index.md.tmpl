# Oasis Provider

The Terraform Oasis provider is a plugin for Terraform that allows for the full lifecycle management of ArangoGraph Insights Platform resources.

Api keys can be generated and viewed under the user's dashboard view on the API Keys tab.
On a logged in view, navigate to [API Keys](https://cloud.arangodb.com/dashboard/user/api-keys) and hit the button
labeled `New API key`. This will generate a set of keys which can be used with ArangoDB's public API.
